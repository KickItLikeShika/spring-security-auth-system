# Spring Security Authentication System

Securing Web app with authentication using Spring Boot, Spring Security, MySQL, and JPA.
It shows some features of Spring security, how to login/register, and make some other security configuration.
It also uses Thymeleaf as a template engine.

# Why? 

I wrote this because I had to get into Spring security and found it actually quite hard to find good examples and documentation. I hope others can learn from this.
